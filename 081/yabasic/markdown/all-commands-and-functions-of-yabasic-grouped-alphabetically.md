default — mark the default-branch within a switch-statement

dim — create an array prior to its first use

do — start a (conditionless) do-loop

doc — special comment, which might be retrieved by the program itself

docu$ — special array, containing the contents of all docu-statement within the program

dot — draw a dot in the graphic-window


## E

else — mark an alternative within an if-statement

elsif — starts an alternate condition within an if-statement

end — terminate your program

endif — ends an if-statement

end sub — ends a subroutine definition

eof — check, if an open file contains data

eor() — compute the bitwise exclusive or of its two arguments

error — raise an error and terminate your program

euler — another name for the constant 2.71828182864

foreign_buffer_free — free a foreign buffer

foreign_buffer_get() — extract a number from a foreign buffer

foreign_buffer_get$() — extract a string from a foreign buffer

foreign_buffer_get_buffer$() — take a buffer and construct a handle to a second buffer from its content

foreign_buffer_set_buffer — store a pointer to one buffer within another buffer

foreign_buffer_size() — return the size of the foreign buffer

foreign_function_call() — call a function (returning a number) from a non-yabasic library or dll

foreign_function_call$() — call a function (returning a string or a buffer) from a non-yabasic library or dll

foreign_function_size() — return the size of one of the types available for foreign function calls

frnbf_ and frnfn_ — Abbreviations for foreign_buffer_ and foreign_function_

frac() — return the fractional part of its numeric argument


## G

getbit$() — return a string representing the bit pattern of a rectangle within the graphic window

getscreen$() — returns a string representing a rectangular section of the text terminal

glob() — check if a string matches a simple pattern

gosub — continue execution at another point within your program (and return later)
