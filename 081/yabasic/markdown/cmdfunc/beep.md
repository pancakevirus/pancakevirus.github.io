# beep

Ring the bell within your computer; a synonym for bell.

## Synopsis

```basic
beep
```

## Description

The ```bell```-command rings the bell within your computer once. This command is *not* a sound-interface, so you can neither vary the length or the height of the sound (technically, it just prints ```\a```). ```bell``` is exactly the same as ```beep```.

## Example

```basic
beep:print "This is a problem ..."
```
