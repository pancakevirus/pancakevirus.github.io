# bell

Ring the bell within your computer (just as ```beep```).

## Synopsis

```
bell
```

## Description

The ```bell```-command rings the bell within your computer once. This command is *not* a sound-interface, so you can neither vary the length or the height of the sound (technically, it just prints ```\a```). ```bell``` is exactly the same as [```beep```](bell.html).

## Example

```basic
print "This is a problem ...":bell
```
