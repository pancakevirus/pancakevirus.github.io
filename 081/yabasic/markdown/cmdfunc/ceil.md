# ceil()

Compute the ceiling for its (float) argument.

## Synopsis

```basic
print ceil(x)
```

## Description

The ```ceil```-function returns the smallest integer number, that is larger or equal than its argument.

## Example

```basic
print ceil(1.5),floor(1.5)
print ceil(2),floor(2)
```

Comparing functions ```ceil``` and ```floor```, gives a first line of output (```1 2```), showing that ```ceil``` is less or equal than ```floor```; but as the second line of output (```2 2```) shows, the two functions give equal results for integer arguments.
