## Comparing strings or numbers

Yabasic, of course, allows to compare strings with strings and numbers with numbers; ```\<```, ```\<=```, ```\>``` and ```\>=``` compare their left-hand side to their right-hand side as usual; nothing new here and examples can be found throughout this manual.

More interesting, the *equality*-operator (for numbers as well as for strings) can be written *in two different ways*: either as ```=``` (traditional) or as ```==``` (more modern). The second form has the advantage of beeing visually distinct from the *assignment*-operator, which is the single ```=```. One may argue therefore, that using ```==``` results in code, that is easier to understand and read; This manual however sticks to tradition and mostly uses the single ```=``` for equality-check.

Finally, inequality can be checked with ```<>``` or ```!=```; both operators behave identically and so it is only a matter of taste, which one to use.
